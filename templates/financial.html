		  <h3>Finances During School</h3>
    
    <p>
    As college students persue a further education, many find themselves in various states of financial satisfaction. Because of this, there will be times where students have to take out loans or apply for other payment methods to help cover the financial side of college. However, without proper financial knowledge, debt totals can reach a high that may be too much on the student handle both during school and after they graduate. According to a study from the <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1043230.pdf">Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning</a>, where the authors found that students of middle and low resource schools were hesiant about taking out student loans. This is in addition to using credit cards since financial aid is not enough. Debt can also grow if a student has little financial knowledge or literacy (money related practices such as investing, saving, money management, and more), which can lead to lower financial satisfaction (a person's satisfaction of their income, amount of saved wealth, and more). This can spiral into a worse psychological state that can spiral.

  <h3>Psychological Toll of Debt</h3>
    <p>
        The presence of debt can be taxing on an individual's mind, especially a young college student who may have other stressors in their lives. According to <a href="https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/resources/student-loans/"> accreditedschoolsonline.org </a>, there can be negative financial thoughts. Can a student can get their first job out of school? Can they afford a house or car or other big purchases? Questions can pop up when the reality of the size of their debt comes to mind. This can lead to manifestations of depression, anixiety, and extreme stress. However, there are many solutions to both lessen the weight of debt and the anxiety that comes with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        While varying from person to person, those seeking a higher education in graduate school or some other form can also factor into a student's mental health. An author from the <a href="https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2013/01/debt">American Psychological Association </a> states how sometimes, a person can fall into financial denial, where a person become irresponsible with their finances like spending without a budget and just paying no mind to money.
